/**
 * Multilingual Markdown generator - base Token class
 *
 * The Lexer::tokenize() function transforms an UTF-8 text buffer into an array of successive
 * parts of different types like text, escaped text, language directives, end of lines etc.
 * The Token class is the base class for each of these possible parts.
 *
 * Some token types are only recognized when another one is interpreted. For example,
 * escaped text is only found when the opening escaper token is found. Most tokens can
 * not happen inside escaped text except the ones closing the escaped sequence. The opening
 * token interprets the text flow and detects both the escaped text and the closing escape
 * sequence while Lexer only finds the opning token.
 *
 * Construction parameters depend on the Token: not all tokens need a keyword or a content.
 * Some tokens are unique in the whole system and never change, while some have a content
 * and need to be instanciated for each content.
 *
 * A Token is responsible for a few tasks:
 *
 * - self-identification against a given input or buffer content and position
 * - do any processing with input, advancing current position where appropriate
 * - tell Lexer if it should process outputs after this token
 * - send output to a Filer when asked for
 * - tell Lexer to append it to the token flow when needed
 *
 * Input processing should be done only after a positive self identification: the token will not
 * check for this. Some tokens do no process a buffer but rather simply store an information:
 * then processInput() will do nothing and will advance the position only right after the token.
 *
 * During processInput(), the token can use Lexer::appendToken() to append itself to the tokens
 * or add other tokens depending on its needs. TokenHeading for example doesn't append itself
 * but rather appends a sequence of tokens to compose the whole heading content including
 * the '#' prefix, the optional numbering and the needed anchors for table of content links.
 * See TokenHeading class for more details.
 *
 * The Token::output() function is called by Lexer to output some content to output files.
 * The outputs are done through the Filer class instance which is given to output().
 * Tokens which have nothing to output will simply do nothing in the function, other will
 * rather act on Lexer to update the generation context. Both Filer and Lexer instances
 * are given as parameter to output() so it can work on them.
