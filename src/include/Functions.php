function displayHelp(): void

    echo "
Multilingual Markdown generator - version " . MLMD_VERSION . "

Parameters:

-h  display this help.

[-i] <filepath.mlmd|filepath.base.md>
    add a file to input files. MLMD will generate one <filepath.xx.md> 
    file for each languages 'xx' declared in the '.languages' directive.
    If -i is not used the script assumes the parameter is an input file path.

-out html|md
    choose HTML or MD for links and anchors for Table Of Contents

-main <mainFilename[.mlmd|.base.md]>
    add a main file (supposedly the one with a global TOC including levels 1-n)
    and indirectly set the root directory for all other files

-numbering <def>[,...]
    declare at least one heading numbering definition, where <def> is: 
        [<level>]:<symbol><separator>
        where :
            <level> is 1 to 9 (default = 1 or next level after level of previous def)
            <symbol> is from 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '1'..'9'
            <separator> is a single character e.g. '.' or '-'

-od <directory>
    set the output root directory, in which written files will mirror the 
    input file root directory

If no '-i' and '-main' parameter is given, MLMD explores current and sub directories
for '*.base.md' and '*.mlmd' template files and generates files for each template found.
By default, main file will be README.mlmd or README.base.md if such a file is found 
in current directory.
 
The '-main' option sets the base file name referenced by the {main} variable (see below) and
sets the root directory for all links in all files. Preferably, all the other template files
should be in this root directory or in subdirectories.

Template files must be named with .base.md or .mlmd extension, other extensions are ignored.

Directives in templates control the languages specifics files generation.

Global directives on one line:
- .languages    declares languages codes (global)
- .numbering    sets the heading numbering schemes (global, also available
                as script argument and .toc parameter)
- .toc          generates a table of contents using headings levels
- .topnumber    set the level 1 heading (single '#') logical number
- .end          end the source file
- .stop         help to put a debugging brezkpoing in mlmd script

Directives anywhere in the text and in headings:
- .all((        starts a section for all languages
- .ignore((     starts an ignored section
- .!((          identical to .ignore((
- .default((    starts a section for languages which don't have a specific section
- .((           identical to .default((
- .<language>(( starts a section specific to <language>
- .))           ends a section
- .{ .}         encloses escaped text (no variable expansion)

Markdown escape markers are recognized by MLMD and written into output files. The escaped
text will be written exactly as it appears with no language specific transformation and no
variable expanding (see below).

- text can be escaped anywhere between Markdown back-ticks '`', double back_ticks '``', 
  triple backticks '```' and double quotes '\"'; The markers are written in output files
- text can be escaped between Markdown code fences '```' at the beginning of a line;
  the surrounding code fence lines are written in output files
- text can be escaped between specific MLMD markers '.{' and '.}'; the markers
  will not be written in output files

MLMD specific escape markers can be used to surround MLMD directives so they can be
written in output files instead of being interpreted..

When not between escape markers, the following variables are expanded in each generated file:

- {file} expands to the current file name, localised for the language
  ('file.xx.md' for language 'xx', 'file.md' for main language)
- {extension} expands to the current written file extension
  ('.xx.md' for language 'xx', '.md' for main language)
- {main} expands to the '-main' file name, localised for the language
  ('main.xx.md' for language 'xx' or 'main.md' for main language)
- {language} expands to the language code as declared in the
  '.languages' directive ('xx' for language 'xx')
