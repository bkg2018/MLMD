/**
 * Multilingual Markdown generator - Storage class
 *
 * The Storage class handles buffers for reading text from an input file. The filenames and pathes are not
 * managed by Storage, which uses a file handle sent by the caller. The file is neither opened
 * nor closed by Storage but the current file positions are modified by Storage when reading, so callers
 * should not rely on positions nor alter them unless explicitly expected. The Storage class
 * gives functions to advance in input file and check previous or next characters without
 * moving the current position.
 *
 * See the Filer class for file names handling and files opening.
 *
 * Ends of lines are normalized to a single \n (0x0A ASCII) character alone with no \r (0x0D ASCII).
 *
 * NOTATION:
 *      - EOL means end of line and/or the end-of-line control character (\n)
 *      - EOF means end of file.
